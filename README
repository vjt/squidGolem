SquidGolem - A SquidGuard replacement

SquidGolem is a drop-in replacement for squidGuard,
as long as you're inclined in rewriting its configuration
into a more modern way: using a SQL backend.

It implements:

  * The squid redirector interface
  * Sources definition, basing on IP addresses and/or User
  * Destination definition, currently only domain-based
  * ACLs, that link together Sources, Destinations and
    the current time.

It will implement:

  * A nifty web interface to manage its settings.

SquidGuard is written in Ruby by <vjt@openssl.it>
