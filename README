SquidGolem - A SquidGuard replacement

SquidGolem is a drop-in replacement for squidGuard,
as long as you're inclined in rewriting its configuration
into a more modern way: using a SQL backend.

The core of ACL processing and checking is lent to the
RDBMS, with the usage of Views and Stored Procedures.

Benchmarks will tell whether caching is necessary inside
squidGolem itself.

It implements:

  * The squid redirector interface
  * Sources definition, basing on IP addresses and/or User
  * Destination definition, currently only domain-based
  * ACLs, that link together Sources, Destinations and
    the current time.

It will implement:

  * A nifty web interface to manage its settings.

SquidGuard is written in Ruby by <vjt@openssl.it>, and
uses EventMachine for its event-based IO Loop.
